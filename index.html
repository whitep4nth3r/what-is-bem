          Have you ever worked on an application with one huge CSS file and found that when you
          changed a style rule in one place, something unexpected happened somewhere else? I had
          this problem a lot in my early days of front end development. It was frustrating! So what
          can you do to stop this from happening?
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__heading">You need to scope your style rules!</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          To scope your CSS means to encapsulate style rules in a systematic way so that they apply
          to one particular chunk of HTML only. CSS-in-JS solutions such as
          <a
            href="https://styled-components.com/"
            class="article__link"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow"
            >Styled Components</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules"
            class="article__link"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener nofollow"
            >CSS modules</a
          >
          that ship with front end frameworks have largely solved this problem by scoping styles to
          your component templates as standard. This means you don't need to worry about classes in
          one component affecting the styling of another component — even if you use the same class
          name. Nice!
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          But what if you're just starting out, and you want to focus on building out pure CSS in a
          systematic way without getting bogged down with CSS-in-JS?
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__heading">Working in pure CSS</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In order to scope your styles in pure CSS, the aim is to declare your CSS classes
          specifically and solely for individual HTML components. Style rules should be purposefully
          verbose and self-documenting, without relying on inheritance or default browser behaviour.
          This type of system discourages the use of utility classes reused across multiple
          components because this is where you can run into the problems described at the beginning
          of the post. If you change the style properties of a utility class used in multiple
          components, it could affect the layout of your whole application — sometimes with very
          undesirable results!
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Let's take a look at how we can harness the power of a system like BEM.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__heading">What does BEM stand for?</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          BEM stands for block, element, modifier, and it's a super-handy system to help you scope
          CSS style properties to blocks of HTML. What's more, it encourages you to make your HTML
          and CSS descriptive and self-documenting — helping identify the purpose and intended
          function of the CSS classes in the code itself.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Other class naming conventions exist alongside BEM to help you scope styles when writing
          HTML and CSS — such as OOCSS and SMACSS. You can even roll your own system! But the most
          important thing to remember is to use a system, stick to that system, and make it work for
          you.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">So, how do we work with BEM?</p>
        <h2 class="article__heading">Block, element, modifier</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">Let's take a look at the building blocks of BEM.</p>
        <h3 class="article__subheading">
          Block: a chunk of HTML to which you want to scope styles
        </h3>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
.block {  
}</pre
        >
        <h3 class="article__subheading">
          Element: any element inside that block, name-spaced with your block name
        </h3>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
.block__elementOne {
}

.block__elementTwo {
}</pre
        >
        <h3 class="article__subheading">
          Modifier: a flag to modify styles of an existing element, without creating a separate CSS
          class
        </h3>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
.block__elementOne--modifier {
}</pre
        >
        <h3 class="article__subheading">BEM syntax conventions</h3>
        <ul class="article__unorderedList">
          <li class="article__unorderedListItem">
            Use one or two underscores to separate the block name from the element name
          </li>
          <li class="article__unorderedListItem">
            Use one or two dashes to separate the element name and its modifier
          </li>
          <li class="article__unorderedListItem">Use descriptive class names in camelCase</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="article__heading">BEM in context</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In context, your HTML using the above class names might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
&lt;section class="block"&gt;
    &lt;p class="block__elementOne">This is an element inside a block.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="block__elementOne block__elementOne--modifier"&gt;This is an element inside a block, with a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre
        >
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In a real-life example, with more realistic class names, this might look like:
        </p>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
&lt;section class="container"&gt;
  &lt;p class="container__paragraph"&gt;This is a paragraph inside a container.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="container__paragraph container__paragraph--bold"&gt;
    This is a paragraph inside a container, with a modifier that adds bold styling.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre
        >
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Using the fully-declarative approach, where you don't rely on inheritance or default
          browser styles, your CSS classes might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="article__codeBlock">
.container {
  display: block;
  margin: 1rem auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
    
.container__paragraph {
  color: #000000;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: normal;
  line-height: 1.2;
  margin: 0 0 1rem 0;
}
  
.container__paragraph--bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}</pre
        >
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Notice how any default browser behaviour we might take for granted has been declared in
          the above classes — such as display: block on the .container &lt;div&gt; element. This is
          an extremely useful way to ensure that if you need to switch up the HTML elements in your
          components — for example swapping the &lt;div&gt; (default display: block) for a
          &lt;span&gt; (default display: inline) in the above example — the resulting styles of your
          components are not affected.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__heading">Wrapping up</h2>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Using BEM is not going to solve all your CSS problems (good luck with centring those
          &lt;div&gt; elements in your layouts!), but it can help you take a step in the right
          direction to make your CSS readable, descriptive, and safe from any unexpected results.
          Again, the most important thing to remember is to use a system, stick to that system, and
          make it work for you.
